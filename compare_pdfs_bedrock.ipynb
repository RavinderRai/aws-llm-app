    "# Comparing two PDFs with AWS Bedrock\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post we'll go over an extension of the typical app to chat with a PDF using RAG. Here we will specifically take in two PDFs, and compare them using a custom prompt. We'll also configure it to let the user decide if they only want to chat with one or both documents. Credits to Krish Naik for the original idea: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE5XrxGvbo&t=1065s. Also, see my GitHub repo for the code, and note that I used Python 3.12 in this case: https://github.com/RavinderRai/aws-llm-app.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, make sure you have the AWS command line installed, streamlit, faiss-cpu (for vectorstores), langchain, PdfReader, and boto3. In AWS, you will also need to get access to a foundational model of your choice in AWS Bedrock. Keep in mind that it might not be free, so be careful with the use case (though it didn't cost me anything for this app). You can also find these requirements and the versions that were used here: https://github.com/RavinderRai/aws-llm-app/blob/main/requirements.txt.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to do of course is create a app.py file (or whatever you want to name it) for all the code below, and start with loading in the imports. Also instantiate bedrock and bedrock embeddings."

    " - Then we iterate through each page in the PDF and concatenate it all into one string.\n",
    " - Next we divide the text into chunks of size 10000, and the chunk_overlap is to prevent odd break points in the text when we do this split, so relevant context isn't lost.\n",
    " - Finally we get these chunks into a list and convert them into Documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Document function we get from langchain, and use as we are staying in the langchain ecosystem, but it is really just another way to store text data. It's like a dictionary with pageContent and metadata as keys. The metadata is meant to track things like the source of the text, but in this case we just leave it blank."
