    "In this post we'll go over an extension of the typical app to chat with a PDF. Here we will specifically take in two PDFs, and compare them using a custom prompt. We'll also configure it to let the user decide if they only want to chat with one or both documents. \n",

    "To get started, make sure you have the AWS command line installed, streamlit, faiss-cpu (for vectorstores), langchain and boto3. In AWS, you will also need to get access to a foundational model of your choice in AWS Bedrock. Keep in mind that it might not be free, so be careful with the use case (though it didn't cost me anything for this app).\n",
